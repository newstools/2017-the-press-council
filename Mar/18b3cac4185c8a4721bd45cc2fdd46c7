The sole director at the time was applicant&rsquo;s wife who was a police clerk.&nbsp; The company (&ldquo;MPA&rdquo;) was described as a debt collection company. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicant was unhappy that the company was described as a debt collection company.&nbsp; He argued that the company did a range of things, including forensic investigations, security etc.&nbsp; It should be mentioned that the article followed a negative report from the office of the Public Protector.&nbsp; The applicant&rsquo;s complaint is that the company did not only do debt collection, but other things as well, as stated above.&nbsp; He did not deny that two days before the tender was awarded to MPA, he underwent a 5 day crash course in forensic investigation.&nbsp; He also complained that it was inaccurate of the respondent to say that the company was paid R6m to investigate the theft of computers; according to him, they were to investigate a host of other things such as procurement of tenders.&nbsp; He also complained: &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the article falsely said his wife was still working for the police, when she had resigned two months earlier; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that his recorded admission that he had not tendered for the work but was just asked by the MEC to do the work was supposed to be off the record. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday Times defence was inter alia: 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the article was in the public interest; 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the story was a &ldquo;straightforward news report&rdquo; of the Public Protector&rsquo;s provisional report etc. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ombud considered all the submissions, and dismissed the complaint in his Ruling dated 2 February 2017.&nbsp; I agree with his decision as well as the reasons given.&nbsp; It must be taken into account that: 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article was indeed based on a report by the Public Protector. 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While MPA did other jobs, it certainly also listed debt collection as one of its activities. 4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucially, it cannot be denied that the applicant did mention that he was out in Kruger National Park when he was invited to take the job for which MPA was pad &plusmn; R6m by the MEC; and that he admitted he had not submitted any documents to tender for it.&nbsp; True, he says it was meant to be off the record, but apparently he did not secure this beforehand. 4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the matter was of huge public interest. 4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the applicant is irked by the allegation that the R6m was for the investigation of the theft of computers, this information came from the MEC. 4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days before the contract was awarded, the applicant underwent a five day crash course in forensic investigation. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the reasons given by the Ombud and those mentioned above, I am of the view that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of success before the Appeals Panel; accordingly, the application is turned down. Dated this 20th day of March 2017 Judge B M Ngoepe, Chair, Appeals Panel
