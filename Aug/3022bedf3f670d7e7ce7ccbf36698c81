In the matter of INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS AND DR SURV&eacute;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APPLICANTS AND SUNDAY TIMES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESPONDENT MATTER NO: 3331/05/2017 DECISION ON AN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent Newspapers and Dr Surv&eacute; (&ldquo;applicants&rdquo;) filed a complaint against the Sunday Times (&ldquo;respondent&rdquo;) in respect of an article which appeared in the respondent&rsquo;s edition of 14 May 2017 with the headline &ldquo;Surv&eacute; &lsquo;canned editor over Molefe article&rsquo;&rdquo;. Dr Surv&eacute; is the chairperson of Independent Newspapers. The essence of the article was that the applicants sacked their journalist (Mr Mbhele) for his unflattering article in the Sunday Independent about one Brian Molefe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday Independent falls within the Independent Newspapers stable. I need not go into the details of the article, save to briefly sketch the following picture by the applicants: contrary to what the Sunday Times stated, Mbhele was not dismissed or &ldquo;fired&rdquo;. All that was asked of him in relation to the article was a report on the facts, given the fact that Dr Surv&eacute; had received complaints about the inaccuracy of some of the things mentioned.&nbsp; In fact, already before he produced the article in the Sunday Independent, Mbhele had indicated that he wanted to leave for a position as an academic.&nbsp; At a meeting between the applicants&rsquo; chief of staff and financial officer with Mbhele, which was meant to discuss other things, Mbhele firmed up his decision to leave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terms for his departure were agreed upon, but made confidential.&nbsp; He was, therefore, not &ldquo;fired&rdquo; as alleged by the respondent.&nbsp; After stating some facts in their complaint, the applicants submitted that the respondent had breached articles 1.1, 1.2 and 10 of the Press Code, and asked that &ldquo;Sunday Times provides a formal apology which is corrected on the same page and prominence on which the offending article took place&rdquo;. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicants&rsquo; complaint was subsequently summed up by the Ombud in his Ruling dated 26 June 2017.&nbsp; They complained that the article: &ldquo;l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made several false untruthful and unfair claims and allegations&hellip;&hellip; the crux of which was that: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an article in the Sunday Independent about Molefe was said to have led to former editor Waly Mbhele&rsquo;s dismissal; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suve&rsquo;s &lsquo;interference&rsquo; in editorial operations was expected to raise concerns from other media owners about Independent newsrooms; and l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was unbalanced, biased and omitted material responses from Independent Media. They also complain that the: l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newspaper&rsquo;s information was fabricated and that its (single) &lsquo;source&rsquo; was not credible or reliable; and l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; headline, the kicker and the caption were misleading&rdquo;. The Ombud then went into the details of the complaint. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent&rsquo;s response, which was as detailed as the complaint itself, can be summed up as follows: respondent had relied on a number of sources, including senior people with the applicants, who confidentially told respondent that Mbhele was dismissed; no letter or resignation by Mbhele could be produced; applicants&rsquo; contention that the resignation was verbal was not acceptable as it was highly unlikely that Mbhele would resign without tendering a written resignation. Regarding the headline, it was put in quotation marks to show that it was merely an allegation.&nbsp; Again, the Ombud gave a detailed account of the defence. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the Ombud dismissed the complaint in its entirety, hence this application.&nbsp; It bears mentioning that for the application to succeed, the applicants must show reasonable prospects of success before the Appeals Panel of the Press Council.&nbsp; In light of the grounds of appeal, in which the Ombud&rsquo;s Ruling is criticized, I had to read the Ruling carefully, with due regard to the material at hand. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am satisfied that the Ombud analysed the issues thoroughly and accurately.&nbsp; It is a lengthy and detailed Ruling.&nbsp; There is one part of it which is so material and telling that I should restate: &ldquo;I am satisfied that the journalists &ndash; from start to finish, and consistently &ndash; referred to sources, either directly or indirectly, and not once presented the sourced information as fact.&nbsp; &hellip; Morever, even the headline put the statement in inverted commas, indicating a source. I have nevertheless asked Barends for a copy of Mbhele&rsquo;s letter of resignation &ndash; which, given all of the above, would have been the only way for me to find for the complainant on this issue. I note that she has indicated, in the complaint, that the editor resigned verbally, and that a confidential agreement was thereafter prepared and signed by Mbhele and Plaatjies.&nbsp; Despite that, I expected a written resignation to follow &ndash; hence my request&rdquo;. I refer to the above, not because I am making a finding that Mbhele definitely did not resign but was fired, but to demonstrate that there is a huge hurdle the applicants would have to overcome before the Appeals Panel, albeit on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; As said earlier, the Ombud studiously went through all the points and motivated his Ruling quite well in respect of all the material issues raised. Allegations in the application for leave to appeal [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their application for leave to appeal, the applicants allege that the Ombud, by soliciting and then receiving some information from the respondent, committed a reviewable irregularity; they allege breach of the rules of natural justice (&ldquo;audi, alteram partem&rdquo;). Properly understood, the applicants&rsquo; desire would have resulted in the identification of the respondent&rsquo;s sources of information, or at least render the identification virually open. In this respect the respondents, correctly, refer to and rely on Bosasa Operations Pty Ltd vs Basson and Another 2013(2) SA 570 (GSJ) and Malema v Rampedi and Others 2011(5) SA 631 (GSJ).&nbsp; Nor does what the Ombud did show any bias, as alleged. There is no basis to believe that had no credible sources been shown to have existed, he would not have held that against the respondent. [7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not agree that the Ombud erred in finding that the respondent did not present sourced information as fact, as contended for by the applicants in their notice of appeal. I also believe that the Ombud dealt excellently with the affidavits of Howe, Ncube and Plaatjies.&nbsp; I appreciate that the applicants went into detail in the grounds of appeal, but, for the reasons given above by the Ombud as already explained above, I find no fault with the Ruling.&nbsp; In fact, with regard to the question of sources, the respondent, in opposing the application, tendered an affidavit to me by one source.&nbsp; Given the view I am taking, that would not be necessary. [8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of what I say above, and the reasons given by the Ombud, I am of the view that the application has no reasonable prospects of success.&nbsp; The application is therefore dismissed.
