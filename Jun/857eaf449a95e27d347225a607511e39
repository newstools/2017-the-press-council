In the matter of CITTY PRESS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIRST APPLICANT RAPPORT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECOND APPLICANT AND BAYOGLU VUSLAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESPONDENT MATTER NO: 3159/03/2017 DECISION ON AN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vuslat Bayoglu (&ldquo;respondent&rdquo;), lodged a complaint with the Press Ombud in connection with two articles: one in City Press (&ldquo;first applicant&rdquo;) and the other one in Rapport (&ldquo;second applicant&rdquo;).&nbsp; The two articles appeared on the same day, namely, 5 February 2017.&nbsp; The respondent himself says, correctly, of the two articles: &ldquo;Although this complaint relates to two separate articles in two different newspapers, given that the articles are almost identical in content, I will deal with both articles in one complaint&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Ombud did the same; I will do likewise. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent is of Turkish origin, and has been in this country for years; in fact he is a permanent resident.&nbsp; The gist of the respondent&rsquo;s complaint was that, in both newspapers, he was described as a Turkish fugitive; a &ldquo;mafia&rdquo;, that he was sought back in Turkey for terrorism; that he had smuggled money into South Africa; that they were wanted back in Turkey as part of a terror group.&nbsp; He complained that by making all these allegations, respondent contravened certain articles of the Press Code.&nbsp; He denied all the above allegations, individually.&nbsp; He wanted the applicants to publish an apology, retraction and correction as a matter of urgency, and for the articles to be removed from the News24 websites.&nbsp; He adds that the articles caused harm to his dignity, and reputation.&nbsp; He also complained that he was not contacted for comment. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gist of the applicants&rsquo; defence was that the respondent was indeed contacted for comment.&nbsp; Applicants also argued that not only were the allegations contained in a Turkish Newspaper, the Daily Sabah quoting the former ambassador to South Africa, but that the journalist also conducted her own verification of the allegations.&nbsp; She established, i.a with the National ... Authorities that there was an urgent investigation of the allegations; secondly, that Milker took steps not to advertise its armoured vehicles as it was not authorised to engage in their manufacture. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Ruling, the Ombud dismissed all the complaints but one, namely, respondent&rsquo;s complaint that he was not contact for comment in respect of one particular allegation; that he was a fugitive. The Ombud accordingly held that article 1.8 of the Code of Ethics and Conduct was breached.&nbsp; A sanction was then imposed.&nbsp; As it will appear later when dealing with his counter-application for leave to appeal, the respondent believes the sanction is too lenient. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicants now seek leave to appeal, on a narrow basis. The basis arises as follows: 5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journalist telephonically asked the respondent the opportunity to comment on the allegation of being a refugee; 5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent denied the allegation; 5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent&rsquo;s denial was carried in the report; 5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Ombud, in the written questions or request to the respondent for comment, he was not asked about being a &ldquo;fugitive&rdquo;, but a refugee; it is on the basis that the Ombud held that article 1.8 has been breached. The applicants argue that written questions cannot ... a telephonic interview (in which the opportunity was offered, and not only taken, but the response covered in the article: &ldquo;Any possible doubt whether (the journalist) questioned (the respondent) on the fugitive issue is removed in the article itself when (the journalist) included (respondent&rsquo;s) response&rdquo;. Applicants argue further that article 1.8 of the Code does not prescribe in what form the offer to comment should be. &nbsp;[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In opposing the application, the respondent disputes applicant&rsquo;s understanding of the Ruling of the Ombud.&nbsp; A counter-application for leave to appeal is also filed, both with regard to the merits and the sanction.&nbsp; It is argued for example that the Ombud was mischaracterized the issues; that the applicants misrepresented allegations as facts etc. [7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument raised by the applicants set out in paragraph 5 above is reasonable enough to allow their application for leave to appeal.&nbsp; Less convincing is the respondent&rsquo;s counter-application, especially on the merits.&nbsp; I come to this conclusion after reading the Ombud&rsquo;s analysis and reasoning.&nbsp; He has dealt with the substance of the issues raised by the respondent in a through manner, giving sound reasons.&nbsp; Respondent&rsquo;s counter-application for leave to appeal is also with regard to the sanction imposed by the Ombud.&nbsp; As I am inclined to grant leave to the applicants in respect of the Ombud&rsquo;s finding that they have breached article 1.8 of the Code, I think I should grant leave to the respondent to appeal against the concomitant sanction. [8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following order is therefore made: 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicants are given leave to appeal the Ombud&rsquo;s Rulings that they have breached article 1.8 of the Code in that they failed to give the respondent the opportunity to comment on the allegation that he was a &ldquo;fugitive&rdquo;. 8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent is given leave to appeal against the Ombud&rsquo;s sanction imposed on the applicants.
